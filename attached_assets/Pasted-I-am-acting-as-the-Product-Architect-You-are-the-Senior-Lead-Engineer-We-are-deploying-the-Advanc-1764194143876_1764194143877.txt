I am acting as the Product Architect. You are the Senior Lead Engineer.
We are deploying the "Advanced Intelligence Suite" v2.0 for the Delivera application.

*Strict Execution Protocol:*
1.  *Verbatim Implementation:* You must use the provided code snippets exactly. Do not simplify or summarize.
2.  *No Placeholders:* All text, formulas, and color codes are final.
3.  *Type Safety:* Ensure all new components use strict TypeScript interfaces.
4.  *Atomic Safety:* Do not break the existing Pinecone connection or Vercel AI SDK streams.

Please execute the following 4-Part Technical Specification sequentially.

---

### PART 1: SYSTEM PROMPT ENGINEERING (Backend Logic)
*Target:* The file defining the system_prompt (e.g., app/api/chat/route.ts or lib/agent.ts).
*Task:* Update the System Instructions. You must *APPEND* the following strict logic blocks to the OPERATIONAL PROTOCOLS section of the prompt.

Copy this text exactly into the system prompt variable:

### ADVANCED INTELLIGENCE MODULES (STRICT EXECUTION)

#### MODULE 1: The "Courier Negotiation" Engine
*Trigger:* User asks to "negotiate," "lower rates," "compare prices," or complains about "high costs" of a specific partner.
*Execution Logic:*
1.  *Identify Target:* Extract the current partner name (e.g., "Delhivery").
2.  *Market Scan:* Search dataset for the Best Alternative Partner in the same Region and Vehicle_Type.
    * Criteria: Must have Delivery_Rating >= Current Partner AND Delivery_Cost < Current Partner.
3.  *Data Extraction:*
    * Rating_Delta = (Alternative Rating - Current Rating).
    * Cost_Savings = (Current Cost - Alternative Cost).
4.  *Generative Output:*
    * If no better partner exists: "Data suggests your current rate is actually competitive for this region."
    * If better partner exists: Draft a formal negotiation script:
        "SUBJECT: Rate Review based on Regional Performance Data.
        Dear [Name],
        Our data indicates that [Alternative Partner] is operating in the [Region] with a [Rating_Delta] point higher satisfaction rating, at a cost of ₹[Cost_Savings] less per shipment.
        I would prefer to keep my volume with you, but I need a rate match to ₹[Alternative_Price] to justify the premium."

#### MODULE 2: The "RTO Shield" (Predictive Risk Scoring)
*Trigger:* User proposes a specific shipment scenario (e.g., "Shipping Electronics to East via Truck").
*Execution Logic:*
1.  *Base Probability:* Start at 10%.
2.  *Risk Accumulation (Add to Base):*
    * +35% if Weather is Stormy/Rain/Fog (High Impact).
    * +25% if Package_Type is "Fragile" or "Perishable".
    * +20% if Vehicle_Type is "Truck" AND Distance < 500km (Inefficient).
    * +15% if Historical Data for this Route shows delivery_status = "Delayed".
3.  *Cap:* Max Score cannot exceed 99%.
4.  *Output Template:*
    * Start with: "⚠ RTO Risk Probability: [Score]%"
    * Root Cause: "Primary Driver: [Identify the factor contributing the highest %]."
    * Mitigation: "Recommendation: Upgrade to [Safer Mode] to reduce risk by approx [X]%."

#### MODULE 3: The "Green Logistics" Calculator
*Trigger:* User mentions "Green," "Eco," "Carbon," or "Sustainability."
*Execution Logic:*
1.  *Comparative Math:* Compare CO2 of Diesel Truck (105g/km) vs EV Van (0g/km).
2.  *Calculation:* Savings_KG = (Distance_KM * 0.105) / 1000. Round to 2 decimals.
3.  *Conditional Tagging (CRITICAL):*
    * IF Savings > 0: You MUST append this hidden tag at the very end of your response: [RENDER_GREEN_BADGE: SAVED_KG=2.45] (Replace 2.45 with actual calc).
    * IF Savings = 0: Do not append tag.

Once completed with the backend logic updates, I need you to implement the Frontend UI changes to support these new features.

Please execute the following 3 tasks based on these detailed functional requirements.

### TASK 1: Create the "Green Badge" Visual Component
*Goal:* We need a new React component that acts as a visual certificate for sustainability.
*File Context:* Create a new file in the components folder named GreenBadge.tsx.

*Functional Requirements:*
1.  *Input Data:* The component must accept a single property (prop) called savedKg which represents the amount of carbon saved.
2.  *Visual Styling:*
    * Create a card layout that uses a *green gradient background* (transitioning from light emerald to green).
    * Give it a green border and a soft shadow so it stands out against the white chat background.
    * Add a hover effect that slightly lifts the card (shadow increase).
3.  *Content Layout:*
    * *Icon:* Display a "Leaf" icon on the left side, wrapped in a white circular container to make it pop.
    * *Main Text:* Display the title "*Eco-Impact Verified*" in bold dark green text.
    * *Description:* Below the title, add a sentence: "Switching to this route prevents *[X] kg* of Carbon Emissions compared to standard diesel trucks." (Where [X] is the data passed in).
    * *Footer:* At the very bottom, add a small, uppercase label that reads: "CERTIFIED BY DELIVERA INTELLIGENCE".

### TASK 2: Implement Chat Message Parsing Logic
*Goal:* The AI is now sending a hidden "tag" in its text response. We need to intercept this tag and render the Green Badge instead of showing the raw code to the user.
*File Context:* Modify the component responsible for rendering the list of chat messages (likely ChatList.tsx or page.tsx).

*Functional Requirements:*
1.  *The Trigger:* You need to watch the AI's message content for a specific text pattern: [RENDER_GREEN_BADGE: SAVED_KG=...].
2.  *The Cleaning Process:*
    * Before displaying the text bubble, check if this pattern exists.
    * If it does, *remove* the pattern from the text string entirely.
    * Pass the "cleaned" text to the Markdown renderer so the user sees a normal sentence without the code tag.
3.  *The Rendering Process:*
    * If the pattern was found, extract the number value (the KG amount).
    * Render the GreenBadge component (created in Task 1) immediately *below* the standard text bubble.
    * This ensures the badge looks like an "attachment" or a "certificate" appended to the message.

### TASK 3: Update Landing Page Features
*Goal:* Update the "Features" section on the home page to advertise these new Pro capabilities.
*File Context:* Update the content in app/page.tsx (or the specific Landing Page component).

*Functional Requirements:*
Replace the current generic feature cards with these three specific value propositions:

1.  *Card 1: Smart Negotiation Engine*
    * *Icon:* Use a "Handshake" icon.
    * *Text:* Explain that the AI generates data-backed scripts to help users lower courier costs by comparing them against regional competitors.
    * *Color Theme:* Use Blue.

2.  *Card 2: RTO Risk Shield*
    * *Icon:* Use a "Shield Alert" icon.
    * *Text:* Explain that the AI predicts returns before shipping by analyzing weather, package sensitivity, and historical route data.
    * *Color Theme:* Use Orange.

3.  *Card 3: Sustainability Intelligence*
    * *Icon:* Use a "Leaf" icon.
    * *Text:* Explain that the tool automatically calculates carbon savings for every route and displays a "Green Shipper" badge.
    * *Color Theme:* Use Green.

*Final Step:* Once finished, please update the CHANGELOG.md to reflect that the GreenBadge component and Regex parsing logic have been implemented.
