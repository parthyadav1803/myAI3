I need to upgrade the "Delivera" project into a multi-page SaaS application with rich content.

Please execute the following changes. Ensure code is modular, comments are added, and CHANGELOG.md is updated.

### 1. Architecture & Routing
* *New Routes:* Create dedicated pages for:
    * /features (Detailed breakdown of capabilities)
    * /pricing (Dedicated pricing comparison page)
    * /testimonials (Customer success stories)
    * /demo (The existing Chat Interface)
    * / (The Landing Page)
* *Navbar Update:* Ensure links to "Features", "Pricing", and "Testimonials" navigate to these new separate pages, not scroll anchors.

### 2. Content Expansion (Fill the Pages)
Do not create empty pages. Populate them with the following detailed content:

**A. Features Page (/features)**
* Header: "Intelligence Across Every Mile."
* Section 1 - Smart Partner Selection: Detail how the AI chooses between partners like Delhivery/Blue Dart based on specific regions (North/South) and vehicle types.
* Section 2 - Weather Guard Technology: Explain how we use weather data (Fog, Rain, Heat) to predict delays before they happen.
* Section 3 - Expansion Modeling: Explain the "Market Viability" feature that helps businesses test new regions before launching.
* Section 4 - Cost Optimization: Explain how avoiding RTO (Return to Origin) saves money.

**B. Pricing Page (/pricing)**
* Header: "Simple Pricing for Indian SMBs."
* Structure: Display only TWO tiers.
    * *Free Plan:* ₹0/mo. "Ideal for startups." (Manual Queries, Historical Data Access, Community Support).
    * *Pro Plan:* ₹999/mo. "For scaling brands." (Unlimited Queries, Real-time Weather Integration, API Access, Priority Support, Dedicated Account Manager).
* Comparison Table: Below the cards, add a feature comparison checklist (Checkmarks vs Crosses).
* FAQ Section: Add 3-4 common questions at the bottom (e.g., "Can I cancel anytime?", "Do you support API?").

**C. Testimonials Page (/testimonials)**
* Header: "Trusted by India's Fastest Growing Brands."
* Content: Create a grid of *6 distinct testimonials* (Use dummy data but make it realistic).
    * Include roles like "Ops Head", "Founder", "Logistics Manager".
    * Industries: Fashion, Electronics, Perishables (Food), Handicrafts.
    * Example: "Switching to Delivera for our fragile shipments in the North East reduced breakage by 40%."

### 3. Chat Interface Logic (/demo)
* *Web Search Trigger:* If the AI recommends a specific partner (e.g., Delhivery, Blue Dart), it MUST search specifically for their *Price Calculator* or *Official Landing Page*.
* *Strict Output Format:* The AI must append exactly: "You can calculate exact rates here: [Link]".
* *UI:* Ensure the chat interface is clean and professional.

### 4. Branding (Delivera)
* Ensure the Logo (SVG) and color scheme (Navy Blue #1e3a8a & Saffron Orange #f97316) are consistent across all new pages.
