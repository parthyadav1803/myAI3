I need you to create the About Us page for the Delivera website.

Please implement the same clean, modern layout which you have been following till now with the following 4 Sections. Use the exact text content provided below for each section.

SECTION 1: HERO & VISION

Headline: The Intelligence Behind Your Logistics
Sub-headline: Democratizing enterprise-grade supply chain intelligence for India's 63 million MSMEs.

Body Copy:
At Delivera, we believe that data shouldn't be a luxury reserved for logistics giants. We are the First AI Logistics Strategist built specifically for the Indian market. Born from the chaos of unorganized last-mile delivery, we exist to bring order, transparency, and predictability to small businesses.

We are not a courier company; we are your Intelligence Partner. We sit between you and the logistics provider, using a brain of 25,000+ data points to answer the critical questions that make or break your profit margins: "Is this route safe?", "Is this price fair?", and "Will this package arrive on time?"

Core Intent: To turn your logistics from a cost center into a competitive advantage.

SECTION 2: WHO WE SERVE

Headline: Built for the Builders
Sub-text: Focusing on B2C & D2C Brands, Independent Sellers, and Small Manufacturers.

Body Copy (Narrative):
We serve the B2C brands and D2C disruptors who drive India's economy.

Imagine a founder in Jaipur shipping handicrafts to Assam. Every package is a risk—fog delays, hidden costs, and the dreaded RTO. For too long, small businesses have flown blind.

Delivera exists to change this story.

We replace "gut feeling" with enterprise-grade data. We give you the power to negotiate like a giant, predict delays before they happen, and ship with absolute confidence. We handle the complexity of the last mile, so you can focus on building the next big thing.

SECTION 3: PRICING

Headline: Simple, Transparent Pricing
Copy:
We believe in accessible intelligence. Whether you are just starting out with 10 shipments a month or scaling a D2C brand with 10,000, we have a plan that fits your journey. No hidden fees, just pure ROI.

Copy:
